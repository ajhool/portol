The portol video player used the combination of microservices + micropayments to introduce a new video architecture. Some overall objectives:

 -System uses web 2.0 technologies to reduce distribution costs (JSON, NoSQL + JAVA Servlets, Javascript w/websockets + SSE) 
 
 -Uses new microservices paradigm combined with micropayments
 
   -Focus is on providing ridiculously high quality content (both in terms of the content itself and the resolution, 7.1 channel audio, etc) 
   
 -Full support for most existing DRM technologies (WideVine, playready, marlin) 
 
 -Additional security & authentication above existing DRM
 
 -The nature of this design with rotating keys and per-play authentication make piracy much more difficult
